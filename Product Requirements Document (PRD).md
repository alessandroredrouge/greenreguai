## Background

### Problem Statement

Companies operating in the renewable energy sector face significant challenges in navigating the complex and diverse legal frameworks across different countries. The energy industry is heavily regulated, and staying compliant requires continuous monitoring of laws and regulations that vary widely between jurisdictions. This complexity is amplified for companies operating internationally, often necessitating large teams of legal experts, which is both costly and time-consuming.

### Project Overview

GreenReguAI aims to solve this problem by providing a centralized, continually updated repository of relevant laws and regulations related to renewable energy worldwide. The platform will offer an intuitive, AI-powered interface that allows users to query the database and receive precise, actionable information, complete with direct links to official documents in both English and their original languages.

## Objectives and Goals

- **Primary Objective:** Develop an MVP of GreenReguAI that allows users to access a comprehensive database of renewable energy laws and regulations through an AI-powered chat interface. The MVP will be related to the EU regulation on renewables for now, while the full product will be extended to collect the regulation from most of the world.
- **Goals:**
    - Provide up-to-date information on renewable energy regulations for all countries.
    - Enable users to interact with the database using natural language queries.
    - Link responses to specific sections of official documents for verification.
    - Offer documents in both English and original languages.
    - Automate the data ingestion and updating process using workflow automation tools.
